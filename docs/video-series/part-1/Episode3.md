# Building a High-Level Typed Language in Rust - Part 1

## Episode 3: The AST Checker and Ensuring Code Structure

---

### Opening Scene

*Fade in from black to a computer screen with visuals of an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).*

**Narrator (You):**
>Welcome back to our journey of building a high-level typed language in Rust! Today, we're diving into the AST checker, a crucial component ensuring the structural integrity of our code.

---

### Recap

*Quick visuals from the previous episode, focusing on the parser and the generated AST.*

**Narrator:**
>Last time, we delved into the parser, transforming our source code into an Abstract Syntax Tree. With our AST in hand, it's time to validate its structure.

---

### The Role of the AST Checker

*Visuals: Diagrams showing correct and incorrect AST structures.*

**Narrator:**
>The AST checker walks through our tree, ensuring each node adheres to our language's rules. It's like a grammar check, but for code structure.

### Building Our AST Checker

*Visuals: Flowchart or diagram showing the steps of AST checking.*

**Narrator:**
>Creating an AST checker involves:
>
>1. **Node Validation**: Ensuring each node in our AST is valid within its context.
>2. **Tree Traversal**: Walking through the AST, visiting each node for validation.
>3. **Error Reporting**: Providing detailed feedback on any structural issues.

### Hands-on: Node Validation

*Visuals: Code snippets in Rust, showing the validation of different AST nodes.*

**Narrator:**
>Let's start with node validation. Depending on the node type, we'll have different validation rules. For instance, an `if` node should always have a condition and a body.

### Hands-on: Tree Traversal

*Visuals: Diagrams of ASTs, and Rust code snippets showing tree traversal algorithms.*

**Narrator:**
>With our validation rules in place, we'll traverse the AST. This involves visiting each node, checking its validity, and recursively validating its children.

---

### Error Reporting and Feedback

*Visuals: Code snippets showing error handling and feedback mechanisms.*

**Narrator:**
>When our checker encounters an issue, it's essential to provide clear feedback. In Rust, we can use the `Result` and `Option` types to return detailed error messages, guiding users to fix their code.
