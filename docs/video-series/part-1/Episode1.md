# Building a High-Level Typed Language in Rust - Part 1

## Episode 1: Introduction and Overview

### Opening Scene

*Fade in from black to a computer screen with code snippets in Rust.*

**Narrator (You):**
>Hello, and welcome to the first episode of our series on building a high-level typed language using Rust!

### Overview of High-Level Typed Languages

*Graphics or animations showing different programming languages, emphasizing typed languages like Rust, TypeScript, etc.*

**Narrator:**
>But first, what exactly is a high-level typed language? In simple terms, it's a language that abstracts away most of the machine-level details, allowing developers to focus on the logic and structure of their programs. The 'typed' part means that our language will have a strong type system, ensuring that data behaves in predictable ways.

### Components Overview

*Flowchart or diagram showing the components: parser, AST checker, type inferencer, and AST interpreter.*

**Narrator:**
>Throughout this series, we'll be building several core components. These include:
>
>1. A **parser** to read and understand our language's syntax.
>2. An **AST checker** to ensure our code's structure is correct.
>3. A **type inferencer** to deduce the types of our variables and expressions.
>4. And finally, an **AST interpreter** to execute our code.

### Why Rust?

*Rust logo, snippets of Rust code, and perhaps some performance graphs or other visuals showcasing Rust's strengths.*

**Narrator:**
>You might be wondering, why Rust? Rust offers a unique blend of performance, safety, and modern syntax. Its powerful type system and ownership model make it an ideal choice for building robust systems like our language. Plus, the Rust community is vibrant and supportive, providing a wealth of libraries and tools to aid our development.
