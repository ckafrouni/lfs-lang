# Building a High-Level Typed Language in Rust - Part 1

## Episode 4: Type Inference - Ensuring Type Safety

---

### Opening Scene

*Fade in from black to a computer screen with visuals of various data types and type annotations.*

**Narrator (You):**
>Welcome back to our series on crafting a high-level typed language using Rust! Today, we're diving into one of the most fascinating aspects of modern languages: type inference.

---

### Recap

*Quick visuals from the previous episode, focusing on the AST checker and its role.*

**Narrator:**
>In our last episode, we explored the AST checker, ensuring the structural correctness of our code. With our code's structure validated, it's time to ensure type safety with type inference.

---

### Understanding Type Inference

*Visuals: Diagrams and animations showing variables being assigned types based on their values.*

**Narrator:**
>Type inference is the process of automatically determining the data type of an expression. Instead of relying solely on explicit type annotations, our compiler will deduce types based on how variables and functions are used.

### Building Our Type Inference System

*Visuals: Flowchart or diagram showing the steps of type inference.*

**Narrator:**
>Creating a type inference system involves:
>
>1. **Gathering Constraints**: As we traverse the AST, we collect type constraints based on expressions and their interactions.
>2. **Solving Constraints**: Using collected constraints, we deduce the most specific type for each expression.
>3. **Type Annotation**: Annotating our AST with the inferred types for further stages of compilation.

### Hands-on: Gathering Constraints

*Visuals: Code snippets in Rust, showing how type constraints are gathered from the AST.*

**Narrator:**
>Let's begin by gathering constraints. As we visit each node in our AST, we'll determine potential types based on the node's context and its children.

---

### Hands-on: Solving Constraints

*Visuals: Diagrams and Rust code snippets showing the process of constraint solving.*

**Narrator:**
>With our constraints in hand, we'll solve them to deduce the types of each expression. This might involve unification algorithms and some logic to handle type ambiguities.

---

### Type Safety and Its Importance

*Visuals: Examples of type errors being caught by the compiler.*

**Narrator:**
>Type inference not only makes our language more user-friendly but also ensures type safety. By catching type errors at compile-time, we prevent many runtime errors, leading to more robust programs.
