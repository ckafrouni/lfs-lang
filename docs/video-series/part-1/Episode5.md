---

### Opening Scene

*Fade in with visuals of complex AST structures and tools.*

**Narrator (You):**
>Welcome back! Today, we're exploring advanced tools for our AST and setting the stage for our interpreter.

---

### Recap

*Visuals from the previous episode on type inference.*

**Narrator:**
>We've covered type inference, ensuring type safety. Now, let's enhance our AST with advanced tools.

---

### AST Optimization

*Visuals: Diagrams showing AST before and after optimization.*

**Narrator:**
>Optimization refines our AST, removing redundancies and simplifying expressions for efficient interpretation.

---

### Hands-on: Implementing AST Optimizations

*Visuals: Rust code snippets.*

**Narrator:**
>Let's dive into some common AST optimizations, like constant folding and dead code elimination.

---

### Setting the Stage for Interpretation

*Visuals: Flowcharts showing the interpretation process.*

**Narrator:**
>With an optimized AST, we're ready for interpretation. We'll lay the groundwork for our interpreter in the upcoming episodes.
