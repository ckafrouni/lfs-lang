# Building a High-Level Typed Language in Rust - Part 1

## Episode 2: Diving into the Parser

---

### Opening Scene

*Fade in from black to a computer screen with code snippets, focusing on parsing logic.*

**Narrator (You):**
> Welcome back to our series on building a high-level typed language using Rust! In this episode, we'll dive deep into the heart of our language: the parser.

---

### Recap

*Quick montage or visuals from the previous episode.*

**Narrator:**
> In our last episode, we introduced the series and gave an overview of what we'll be building. Today, we'll start with the first major component: the parser.

### What is a Parser?

*Visuals: Diagrams showing the transition from source code to a structured format (like an AST).*

**Narrator:**
>A parser reads our language's source code and translates it into a structured format, typically an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). Think of it as converting sentences in a language to a tree of meanings.

### Building Our Parser

*Visuals: Flowchart or diagram showing the steps of parsing: tokenization, syntax analysis, etc.*

**Narrator:**
>Building a parser involves several steps:
>
>1. **Tokenization**: Breaking down the source code into 'tokens' or meaningful chunks.
>2. **Syntax Analysis**: Organizing these tokens into a hierarchical structure based on our language's grammar.
>3. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handling any syntax errors in the source code.

### Hands-on: Tokenization

*Visuals: Code snippets in Rust, showing the tokenization process.*

**Narrator:**
>Let's start with tokenization. We'll write a tokenizer in Rust that reads our source code and breaks it down into tokens. Each token represents a meaningful piece of our language, like a keyword, identifier, or operator.

---

### Hands-on: Syntax Analysis

*Visuals: Diagrams of ASTs, and Rust code snippets showing the creation of AST nodes.*

**Narrator:**
>Once we have our tokens, we'll organize them into an AST. This tree structure represents the syntactic structure of our source code, with each node corresponding to a language construct.

---

### Error Handling in Parsing

*Visuals: Code snippets showing error handling mechanisms, perhaps with some intentionally erroneous source code examples.*

**Narrator:**
>Of course, not all source code is perfect. We need mechanisms to detect and report errors. In Rust, we can leverage the `Result` type to handle errors gracefully, providing meaningful feedback to the user.

### Closing Scene

**Narrator:**
>That wraps up our deep dive into parsers! In our next episode, we'll explore the AST checker and ensure our code's structure is correct.
